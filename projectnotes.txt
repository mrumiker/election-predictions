Predictit vs. fivethirtyeight

My idea is to make a website that compares predictions for the upcoming 2020 US election between betting site Predictit and polling aggregate site Fivethirtyeight.com

I will analyze fivethirtyeight's data and use it to analyze some of predictit's election markets such as

"Electoral College Margin of Victory" - 6653

2020 presidential election winner*

Trump win popular vote in 2020? - 5554

Popular Vote Majority for president? - 6833

Winner of popular vote wins Electoral College? - 6642

Tipping Point Jurisdiction

Which party wins the presidency?

Trump wins any state he lost in 2016?

Trump loses any state he won in 2016?

State results

I'll compare the predictions from each website and provide a list of "Best Bets" where 538.com indicates that Predictit is most overvaluing or undervaluing
particular outcomes

Users can also click on a menu to see an overall comparison for the chosen Predictit categories



Electoral MOV Process:

Get contracts from PI (6653) with pidl

Append the probabilities for each result to a list of dictionaries

    keys for each dictionary: "range" "pi_prob"

Open ev_probabilities.csv

calculate the sum of probabilities for each range (taking evprob_inc or evprob_chal as appropriate)

append each result to the list of dictionaries, adding a new key "fte_prob"

print dictionary


STATES

Make a csv with columns: "state" "code" with PredictIt code for each state contest.

Make a "state.html" template to display stats for each state (based on index.html)

Make a States menu where the user can choose from a list of states

    Sends state to a function - finds state code in csv
                                appends it to the predictit html and checks the API
                                Checks 538 csv for state stats

                                return prep([{"Market": market, "Pick": "Biden", "PredictIt Price": pi_bidenwins, "538.com Probability": fte_bidenwins},
                                        {"Market": market, "Pick": "Trump", "PredictIt Price": pi_trumpwins, "538.com Probability": fte_trumpwins}])
